CA2D3,CACNA2D3,55799,calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 3,"The CACNA2D3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, which mediates the influx of calcium ions into cells upon membrane polarization. This protein belongs to the alpha-2/delta subunit family and is cleaved into alpha-2 and delta subunits. The calcium channel complex consists of a complex of alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta, and gamma subunits in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Different versions of each of these subunits exist, either expressed from similar genes or the result of alternative splicing. Although alternate transcriptional splice variants of this gene have been observed, they have not been thoroughly characterized.","The CACNA2D3 gene has been implicated in several diseases, including epilepsy, autism, and bipolar disorder. Targeted drug discovery efforts have focused on developing drugs that modulate the activity of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, which includes the CACNA2D3 protein. One example of a successful drug targeting this complex is pregabalin, which is used to treat neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety disorders. Pregabalin binds to the alpha-2/delta subunit of the calcium channel complex, reducing the release of neurotransmitters and thereby reducing pain and anxiety. Another example is gabapentin, which also targets the alpha-2/delta subunit and is used to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain. These drugs have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials and are widely used in clinical practice.",GO:1990314 cellular response to insulin-like growth factor stimulus;GO:0099174 regulation of presynapse organization;GO:0045933 positive regulation of muscle contraction,Predicted intracellular proteins; FDA approved drug targets:Small molecule drugs; Transporters:Accessory Factors Involved in Transport,Nucleoplasm;Principal piece (Uncertain),Amlodipine; Nilvadipine,,,0
PIAS4,PIAS4,51588,protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4,"PIAS4 is a human gene that encodes for a protein called Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT 4. This protein has two important functions: it enables SUMO ligase activity and ubiquitin protein ligase binding activity. PIAS4 is involved in regulating gene expression by negatively regulating transcription and positively regulating protein sumoylation. It is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. Overall, PIAS4 plays an important role in regulating cellular processes and maintaining proper gene expression.","PIAS4 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and viral infections. In cancer, PIAS4 has been shown to promote tumor growth and metastasis by regulating the activity of transcription factors involved in cell proliferation and survival. In autoimmune disorders, PIAS4 has been linked to the dysregulation of immune responses, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. In viral infections, PIAS4 has been shown to play a role in the replication and pathogenesis of several viruses, including HIV and hepatitis B virus.

Targeted drug discovery efforts for PIAS4 have focused on developing small molecule inhibitors that can block its activity and potentially treat diseases associated with its dysregulation. One example is the development of a PIAS4 inhibitor called ML-792, which has shown promising results in preclinical studies for the treatment of cancer.

Currently, there are no drugs on the market that specifically target PIAS4. However, several drugs that indirectly affect PIAS4 activity have been approved for the treatment of various diseases. For example, the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A has been shown to inhibit PIAS4 activity and is used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine has been shown to reduce PIAS4 expression and is used to treat inflammatory bowel disease.",GO:0060887 limb epidermis development;GO:1902174 positive regulation of keratinocyte apoptotic process;GO:1902172 regulation of keratinocyte apoptotic process,ENZYME proteins:Transferases; Enzymes; Predicted intracellular proteins,Nucleoplasm (Supported); Additional: Centrosome,,(M228)PID SMAD2 3PATHWAY; (M161)PID IFNG PATHWAY; (M58)PID AR PATHWAY,,0
DCPS,DCPS,28960,"decapping enzyme, scavenger","DCPS is a gene that encodes a pyrophosphatase enzyme that removes short mRNA fragments containing the 5' mRNA cap structure. These fragments appear in the 3' to 5' mRNA decay pathway following deadenylation and exosome-mediated turnover. The enzyme hydrolyzes the triphosphate linkage of the cap structure to yield 7-methylguanosine monophosphate and nucleoside diphosphate. This protects the cell from the potentially toxic accumulation of these short, capped mRNA fragments and regulates the activity of other cap-binding proteins. Additionally, DCPS acts as a transcript-specific modulator of pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA turnover.","DCPS has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, viral infections, and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, DCPS has been shown to be overexpressed in several types of tumors, including breast, lung, and colon cancer, and its inhibition has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy. In viral infections, DCPS has been shown to be essential for the replication of several RNA viruses, including influenza and dengue virus, making it a potential target for antiviral drug development. In neurodegenerative disorders, DCPS has been linked to the accumulation of toxic RNA fragments, which can contribute to disease pathology.

Several drug discovery efforts have targeted DCPS, including the development of small molecule inhibitors and RNA-based therapeutics. One example is the small molecule compound RG7834, which has been shown to inhibit DCPS activity and reduce tumor growth in preclinical models of breast cancer. Another example is the use of antisense oligonucleotides to target DCPS expression, which has been shown to reduce viral replication in vitro and in vivo.

Currently, there are no drugs on the market that specifically target DCPS.
